### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Find feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand` and its associated predicate classes. It filters the person list based on specified criteria (subject, level, or price range) and displays matching results.

* `FindCommand#execute()` — Executes the find operation by applying the appropriate predicate to filter the list.
* `FindCommandParser#parse()` — Parses and validates user input to create a valid `FindCommand`.

These operations interact with the `Model` interface through `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to apply the filter and display results.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The application displays the full list of tutors and students.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `find tutor /s maths` command to find tutors teaching mathematics. The `FindCommandParser` validates the input and creates a `FindCommand`. The command executes and calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` with the predicate, filtering the displayed list to show only tutors teaching mathematics.

![UndoRedoState1](images/FindState1.png)

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a find command fails validation (e.g., invalid parameters), the `FindCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException`, and the command will not execute. The user will see an appropriate error message.


</div>

Step 3. The user executes `list` to view all persons again. The `list` command resets the filter by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList`, displaying the complete list of tutors and students.

The following sequence diagram shows how a find operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filtering is applied:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use JavaFX FilteredList with predicates.
  * Pros: Efficient, leverages JavaFX's built-in filtering mechanism. Automatic UI updates when filter changes. Clean separation of filtering logic through predicate classes.
  * Cons: Filter is stateless - each new find command replaces the previous filter completely.

* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a separate filtered copy of the person list.
  * Pros: More control over the filtering process. Could potentially support multiple simultaneous filters.
  * Cons: More complex implementation. Need to manually sync filtered list with source list when data changes. Higher memory usage.

**Aspect: How to handle empty results:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display appropriate message, keep filter applied.
    * Pros: User understands why list is empty. Clear feedback on search outcome.
    * Cons: User must execute `list` to see full list again.

* **Alternative 2:** Automatically reset to full list when no results found.
    * Pros: User always sees something in the list.
    * Cons: Confusing user experience - unclear whether search executed successfully or was ignored.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Primary/secondary school **students** seeking tutors for core subjects (English, Maths, Chinese, Science).
* Freelance **tutors** offering lessons for levels **1–6** (single level or a range).
* Prefers fast, keyboard-centric workflows; comfortable with CLI.
* Needs to **filter** and **match** based on **subject**, **level**, and **price range**.
* Works primarily on desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) with Java 17+.

**Value proposition**: A focused CLI app that **adds/list/finds tutors & students** with clear validators (subject/level/price), and lets users **match/unmatch** pairs quickly and reliably — faster and more consistent than maintaining spreadsheets or generic contact apps

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons (500 tutors and 500 students) without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should respond to any command within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.
5.  Should provide clear and specific error messages for all invalid inputs, guiding users toward correct command format.
6.  Should prevent all duplicate entries as defined by the duplicate handling rules (same type, name, and phone number).
7.  Should recover gracefully from data file corruption by creating a new data file without crashing.
8.  Should validate 100% of user inputs before any data modification to prevent invalid data entry.
9.  Should remain fully operational after any validation error or failed command without requiring restart.
10. Should store all data locally in JSON format that is human-readable and transferable across different operating systems.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private tuition centre database**: A tuition database that is not meant to be shared with others


#### Definitions
* **Tutor / Student** — Person types managed by the app (case-insensitive tokens `tutor` / `student`).
* **Subject** — One of `{english, maths, chinese, science}`.
* **Level** — Integer 1–6 (students: single level; tutors: single level or range `x-y`, 1≤x≤y≤6).
* **Price range** — `min-max` dollars/hour, integers 1–200, `min ≤ max`, no internal spaces.
* **Typed index** — `t<INDEX>` (tutor) or `s<INDEX>` (student), where `INDEX` is 1-based on the **current** list view.
* **Match** — A one-to-one link between a tutor and a student; **Unmatch** removes that link.
* **Duplicate (person)** — Same type **and** same name (case-insensitive) **and** same phone; duplicates are rejected.
